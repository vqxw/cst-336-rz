                <p> Over the past years, technology has aided in and solved some of the biggest health problems,</br>for example, paralysis. </p>
                <p> Paralysis is the loss of ability to move some or all parts of your body. </p>
                <p> It's caused by illness, disease, or injuries. </p>
                <p> There isn't a cure for paralysis, however, scientists may have started to figure out a way</br> to restore movement to certain limbs. </p>
                <p> This website will show you how scientists are able to use technology</br> to help reverse paralysis. </p>
