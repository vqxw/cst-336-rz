                <p> Instead of trying to repair damaged spinal cord pathways, researchers wirelessly</br>
                    connected brain reading technology and stimulators on the spine, which they're calling</br>
                    a neural bypass, in order for thoughts to be able to move limbs.</p>
                <p> Researchers surgically implanted wireless devices into the brains of monkeys to</br>
                    record brain activity.</p>
                <p> The implants act as a bridge between the brain and spine.

                    <cite>"They control leg motion</br>
                    and stimulate muscles in real time</cite>"</a>, according to Tomislav Milekovic, a researcher at</br>
                    <acronym title="Switzerland’s École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne"> SEPFL </acronym></p>
                <p> This artificial interference starts off with an array of about 100 electrodes that</br>
                    are implanted in the motor cortex of the brain (first implant/sensor). A computer</br>
                    receives the brain signals and translates the instructions to a different array of</br>
                    electrodes which are implanted near the spinal injury(second implant/sensor).</br>
                    Once the second implant receives the instructions, it initiates that correct muscle<br>
                    groups in the legs.</p>
