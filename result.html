                <p> What was the result? After six days, a monkey was able to walk on a treadmill</br>
                    without physiotraining.</p>
                <p> The two implants are already in use in humans for other reasons, however, the</br>
                    brain decoding software hasn't been used with humans.</p>
                <p> Although this was a big step in helping restore movement to limbs, the</br>
                    possibility is still hypothetical.</p>
                <p> One reason it's not a fast fix for paralysis is that Humans have different<br>
                    obstacles than a monkey, such as balancing on two legs vs four.</p>
                <p> Christian Ethier, a neuroscientist at Quebec’s Université Laval, pointed out an</br>
                    interesting possibility: the implants may help the body heal itself.</p>

                    “<cite>By re-synchronizing the activity in the brain and spinal motor centers,</a> they could</br>
                    promote what is called ‘activity-dependent neuroplasticity,’ and consolidate any</br>
                    spared connections linking the brain to the muscles</cite>", he says. </p>
                <p> In other words, it could help the body unify brain and spinal cord messages that</br>
                    that weren't getting across to each other, and aid in better recoveries versus</br>
                    physical/rehabilitaiton therapy.</p>
