                <p> In order to try out this experiment, George Courtine, a neuroscientist, and his team</br>
                    used monkeys to test on.</p>
                <p> <a href = "https://www.technologyreview.com/s/603492/10-breakthrough-technologies-2017-reversing-paralysis/">They sliced through the monkey's spinal cord which paralyzed its right leg.</a></p>
                <p> Afterwards, they installed two wireless sensors:</br>
                    A recording device underneath the skull and a nerve simulator made up of electrodes</br>
                    around the spinal cord to bridge the communication.</p>
                <p> The implants worked together to transmit nerve signals between the brain and spine.</p>
                <p> The first implant picks up brain signals which tells the muscles in the legs to walk.</br>
                    The second implant unleashes electricity pulses, depending on the commands</br>
                    from the computer and brain, to imitate nerves that operate muscles within the legs</br>
                    to move and flex, which would lead to walking. </p>
                <p> The brain signals are transferred to a computer wirelessly that decodes them</br>
                    and sends a message to the second sensor (near the spine).</p>
                <p> Because of the implants, the brain signals were able to go over the point of</br>
                    injury in the spine.</p>
                <p> Since there is now a path between the brain and spine, the brain signals can enter</br>
                    the spine and the nerve simulations can activate the legs of the monkeys.</p>
